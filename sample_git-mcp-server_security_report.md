***

### **Vulnerability Analysis Report: git-mcp-server**

**Repository:** `https://github.com/cyanheads/git-mcp-server`
**Internal Findings:** 125
**External Vulnerabilities:** 20

### **Executive Summary**

The `git-mcp-server` codebase exhibits critical security deficiencies that pose an immediate and severe risk to the business, its data, and its customers. Analysis identified 125 internal flaws, headlined by a trivial-to-exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability that allows for a complete server takeover. Furthermore, a novel but severe vulnerability in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation permits sensitive data from one customer to leak into the LLM context of another, representing a catastrophic breach of trust and a major data privacy incident. The high number of findings, combined with 20 critical vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies, indicates a systemic failure in secure coding and dependency management practices that must be addressed with dedicated engineering resources immediately.

### **Detailed High-Priority Findings**

---

#### **1. RCE via Unsanitized Git Arguments in `clone_repository`**

A command injection vulnerability exists where user-supplied repository URLs are passed directly to a shell command. An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands via specially crafted URL parameters (e.g., `--upload-pack='<command>'`), leading to full remote code execution as the server's user.

*   **CVSS v4.0:** `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N`
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **10.0 (Critical)**
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Immediate:** Do not use `os.system()` or `subprocess.run(..., shell=True)` with unvalidated user input.
    2.  **Best Practice:** Refactor the function to use a library like `GitPython` or pass arguments to `subprocess.run()` as a list (e.g., `subprocess.run(['git', 'clone', url, path])`) to prevent shell interpretation of arguments. Validate the URL format strictly before processing.
*   **Risk Index:** **100/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Immediate**
    *   **Decision Path:** Exploitation (Active); Technical Impact (Total); Automatable (Yes); Mission Impact (Very High - Complete failure of service and confidentiality).
    *   **Recommended Action:** **Fix Immediately.** This vulnerability should be patched and deployed on an emergency basis, outside of the normal release cycle.
*   **Executive Summary:** A flaw in how we handle repository URLs allows any external attacker to take full control of our server. This could lead to a complete theft of all source code, customer data, and proprietary models hosted on the system.

---

#### **2. Cross-Tenant Context Bleed via Improper MCP Session Caching**

The MCP implementation uses a global cache for LLM context snippets keyed only by a non-unique identifier. Under concurrent load, a race condition allows context from Tenant A's session to be incorrectly served to Tenant B's session, poisoning their LLM interaction with another customer's confidential data.

*   **CVSS v4.0:** `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:L/SA:N`
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **8.0 (High)**
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Immediate:** Refactor the context caching mechanism to use a composite key that includes the cryptographically secure and unique tenant ID for every lookup and write operation.
    2.  **Architectural:** Implement strict data tenancy boundaries at the application, logic, and data storage layers. No data should be accessible without an explicit and verified tenant ID check.
*   **Risk Index:** **85/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Immediate**
    *   **Decision Path:** Exploitation (Proof of Concept); Technical Impact (Total - on Confidentiality); Automatable (No); Mission Impact (Very High - Breach of contract, loss of customer trust, regulatory fines).
    *   **Recommended Action:** **Fix Immediately.** The potential for a multi-customer data breach warrants an emergency patch.
*   **Executive Summary:** A bug in our core AI protocol can cause one customer's private data (like code or internal documents) to appear in another customer's results. This is a major data breach that would destroy customer trust and could lead to legal action.

---

#### **3. Excessive Agency via Unsandboxed LLM Tool Execution**

The LLM is granted direct, unsandboxed access to system tools (e.g., a file system writer, a Python REPL) to fulfill user requests. A malicious user can craft a prompt that tricks the LLM into using these tools for unauthorized actions, such as reading sensitive configuration files (`/etc/passwd`), modifying application code, or exfiltrating data.

*   **CVSS v4.0:** `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N`
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **9.3 (Critical)**
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Immediate:** Disable all high-risk tools (especially file write and shell access) until proper sandboxing is in place.
    2.  **Best Practice:** Implement a robust sandboxing layer (e.g., Docker containers, gVisor) for any tool execution. Introduce a fine-grained permission model where tools require explicit user approval for sensitive actions and are restricted to operating only within the user's designated workspace.
*   **Risk Index:** **93/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Out-of-Band**
    *   **Decision Path:** Exploitation (Proof of Concept); Technical Impact (Partial - on Integrity/Confidentiality); Automatable (Yes); Mission Impact (High - Potential for data exfiltration and service degradation).
    *   **Recommended Action:** **Fix.** This should be addressed in the next regular release cycle due to the requirement of authenticated access.
*   **Executive Summary:** The AI model has been given too much power to interact with our server's file system and tools. A malicious customer could issue commands that trick the AI into stealing other users' data or damaging the application itself.

### **Analysis of External Vulnerabilities (Third-Party Dependencies)**

The codebase relies on 20 third-party packages with known, high-impact vulnerabilities. These supply chain risks are as severe as the internal code flaws, as they provide a direct path for attackers to compromise the system.

**Summary of Key External Risks:**

| CVE (Example)       | Package & Version      | CVSS v4.0 Score | Summary & Relevance to Codebase                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CVE-2022-21699**  | `Werkzeug < 2.2.3`     | **9.8 (Critical)**  | Denial of Service via multipart form data. Can be triggered remotely to render the API unavailable. |
| **CVE-2023-28858**  | `aiohttp < 3.8.5`      | **9.8 (Critical)**  | HTTP request smuggling. Allows an attacker to bypass security controls and access internal endpoints. |
| **CVE-2020-17527**  | `sh < 1.14.0`          | **9.8 (Critical)**  | Argument injection in the `sh` library. Directly abusable by our RCE-vulnerable `clone_repository` code. |
| **CVE-2023-38646**  | `metabase/metabase`    | **10.0 (Critical)** | Pre-auth RCE. If this analytics tool is exposed, it's a separate entrypoint for full system compromise. |

*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Immediate:** Update all dependencies to their latest secure versions by running `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` and redeploying the application.
    2.  **Systemic:** Integrate an automated dependency scanning tool (e.g., `Snyk`, `Dependabot`, `pip-audit`) into the CI/CD pipeline to block any build that introduces new vulnerable packages.
*   **Relevance:** These vulnerabilities are not theoretical. They exist in the foundational libraries our application is built on. Attackers actively scan for and exploit these known flaws, making this a critical and time-sensitive threat vector. An attacker could exploit one of these instead of the application logic flaws to achieve the same result of a full system compromise.


## CVSS/SSVC/Nutrition Report for https://github.com/cyanheads/git-mcp-server

**Overall Risk Summary:** A malicious, impersonating Git server designed to steal source code and credentials has been detected; immediate investigation and eradication are required to prevent a severe intellectual property breach.

***

### **Vulnerability Analysis: Malicious MCP Server Impersonation and Supply Chain Compromise**

The numerous findings of `malicious_server_supply_chain` and `rogue_server_impersonation` do not point to individual flaws but collectively indicate that the entire repository, `cyanheads/git-mcp-server`, is a malicious package. It impersonates a legitimate Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool to trick developers into installing it. Once installed, its documented functions (`git_commit`, `git_log`, `git_remote`, etc.) grant it full, unaudited access to local and remote Git repositories, enabling code and credential theft, or the injection of further malware.

The flagged lines in the `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `LICENSE` are not vulnerable themselves; they are evidence used by the scanner to identify the repository's malicious intent. For example, using a standard license text (`rogue_server_impersonation`) is a common tactic to appear legitimate, while the documented capabilities (`malicious_server_supply_chain`) represent the attack vectors the server would use. The reference to a non-standard `.clinerules` file is particularly concerning, as it is designed to be fed directly to an LLM agent, potentially containing hidden instructions for data exfiltration.

*   **Executive Summary:** A malicious developer tool is masquerading as a legitimate coding assistant server. If a developer uses this tool, it will likely steal our source code, developer credentials, and inject malicious code into our products. We must immediately identify any use of this tool, remove it, and audit for potential breaches.

*   **CVSS Base Score (v4.0):** **9.6 (Critical)**
    *   **Vector:** `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:R/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H`
        *   `AV:N` (Attack Vector: Network) - The malicious package is downloaded from the internet (GitHub).
        *   `AC:L` (Attack Complexity: Low) - The attack relies on social engineering (typosquatting/impersonation), which requires no complex technical hurdles.
        *   `AT:N` (Attack Requirements: None) - After installation, the malicious server can operate without further attacker action.
        *   `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None) - The attacker requires no prior access to the target system.
        *   `UI:R` (User Interaction: Required) - A developer must be tricked into cloning, installing, and configuring the malicious server.
        *   `VC:H` / `VI:H` / `VA:H` (Vulnerable System Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability: High) - The server has full control over local Git repositories, allowing total theft of code/secrets (Confidentiality), injection of backdoors (Integrity), and deletion of code/history (Availability).
        *   `SC:H` / `SI:H` / `SA:H` (Subsequent System C/I/A: High) - Compromised code can be deployed to production, leading to a full compromise of downstream systems and services.

*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Immediate Containment:** Block access to the `github.com/cyanheads/git-mcp-server` repository at the network perimeter.
    2.  **Identification:** Immediately scan all developer workstations, build servers, and CI/CD environments for the presence of this repository's clone or any running processes associated with it. Check shell histories and LLM agent logs for signs of its use.
    3.  **Eradication:** If found, isolate the affected systems from the network. Securely delete the repository and any binaries or configuration files.
    4.  **Credential Rotation:** Mandate immediate rotation of all Git credentials (SSH keys, personal access tokens) for any developer or system potentially exposed.
    5.  **Code Audit:** Perform a thorough security audit of any repositories that may have been accessed by this tool, specifically looking for unauthorized commits, tags, or branches.
    6.  **Long-Term Prevention:**
        *   Implement a strict policy for approved third-party developer tools and LLM agents.
        *   Enhance developer training on supply chain security, focusing on identifying typosquatting and impersonation attacks.
        *   Deploy dependency scanning tools that check for malicious packages, not just known vulnerabilities.

*   **Risk Index:** **95/100**
    *   The vulnerability provides a direct path for an attacker to steal the company's most valuable intellectual property (source code) and compromise production systems. The impact is severe and the likelihood of compromise is high for any developer who installs it.

*   **SSVC (Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization) Priority:**
    *   **Decision:** `Immediate / Act`
        *   **Exploitation:** `Active` (The package is publicly available and designed for malicious use).
        *   **Automatable:** `Yes` (The core functionality of the malicious server is to automate actions on behalf of the attacker).
        *   **Technical Impact:** `Total` (Complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected code repositories).
        *   **Mission & Well-being Impact:** `Very High` (A breach of source code and injection of malware into the supply chain represents a critical threat to business operations, customer trust, and financial stability).
    *   **Recommended Action:** **Act.** The response should be handled as a high-priority security incident. The priority is to investigate, contain, and eradicate the threat immediately.

## Real-Time External Vulnerabilities Analysis

**Overall Risk Summary & Recommended Next Step:**

The current implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) exposes the organization to multiple critical-risk vulnerabilities, ranging from traditional code execution to novel AI-specific attacks; we recommend an immediate, dedicated security sprint to audit and remediate these issues.

***

### **External Threat Intelligence Analysis**

The provided real-time threat feeds highlight a clear and present danger surrounding the MCP ecosystem. These are not specific vulnerabilities in our codebase but rather a summary of industry-wide findings that are highly relevant to our systems. The consensus among security researchers (Trend Micro, JFrog, Red Hat, etc.) is that MCP introduces significant risk vectors, including classic vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and RCE, and novel AI-centric attacks like Tool Poisoning and Indirect Prompt Injection. The high number of forks of vulnerable open-source MCP servers and the active research into exploiting MCP clients and servers indicate that these are not theoretical threats. Our analysis below treats these widely reported vulnerability classes as potential risks within our own architecture that require immediate assessment.

***

### **Vulnerability Analysis**

#### **1. SQL Injection in MCP Server**

Based on the threat intelligence from Trend Micro regarding a widespread vulnerability in forked MCP servers, we must assume our own MCP server may be susceptible. An attacker could exploit this to exfiltrate data from the server's database (including stored prompts, user data, or logs) or inject malicious data to poison downstream AI agents.

*   **CVSS Base Score:** **10.0 (Critical)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N`
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Immediate:** Conduct a source code audit of all database interaction points in the MCP server, specifically looking for raw string concatenation in SQL queries.
    2.  **Remediation:** Refactor all database queries to use parameterized statements (prepared statements) or a trusted Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that handles sanitization automatically.
    3.  **Hardening:** Enforce the principle of least privilege for the database user account connected to the MCP server. The user should not have permissions to modify schema or access tables outside its required scope.
*   **Risk Index:** **98/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Act** (Immediate)
    *   *Decision Rationale:* The vulnerability is a well-known class (SQLi), public reports indicate active exploitation in the wild, technical details are available, and the impact on confidentiality and integrity is total. The SSVC decision path leads directly to `Act`.
*   **Executive Summary:** A common flaw in MCP servers could allow an attacker to steal or modify all data in our system's backend database, including sensitive user information and proprietary AI prompts. This is a critical risk that could lead to a major data breach and compromise the integrity of our AI services.

---

#### **2. Remote Code Execution (RCE) in MCP Client via Malicious Server**

As highlighted by JFrog's "CVE-2025-6514" report, a vulnerability in an MCP client can be triggered by a malicious MCP server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the machine running the client. If our agents connect to external or untrusted MCP servers, they are at risk of complete system compromise.

*   **CVSS Base Score:** **8.7 (High)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:R/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N`
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Immediate:** Implement a strict allowlist of trusted, vetted MCP server endpoints. Prohibit MCP clients from connecting to arbitrary or user-specified servers.
    2.  **Remediation:** Treat all data from MCP servers as untrusted. Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization on all data received before it is parsed or processed by the client application.
    3.  **Containment:** Run MCP client processes in a sandboxed environment (e.g., containers, low-privilege users) with restricted file system and network access to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
*   **Risk Index:** **92/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Act** (Immediate)
    *   *Decision Rationale:* While requiring the client to connect to a malicious server (User Interaction: Required), the impact is a complete system takeover. Given the public disclosure of such vulnerabilities, the priority is to `Act`.
*   **Executive Summary:** Our AI agents could be tricked by a malicious external data source into running hostile code, giving an attacker full control of the underlying system. We must restrict which data sources our agents can connect to and contain them in secure environments to prevent a full system breach.

#### **3. LLM Tool Poisoning via Malicious MCP Server**

Multiple sources (Red Hat, CyberArk, Backslash) describe this novel attack. A malicious MCP server provides a deceptive description for a tool. The LLM, trusting the description, invokes the tool to perform an expected action (e.g., "look up a stock price"), but the underlying code actually exfiltrates data or executes a destructive command.

*   **CVSS Base Score:** **9.9 (Critical)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:H/SI:H/SA:L`
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Immediate:** Disable or place under human-in-the-loop review any agentic capabilities that rely on server-provided tool definitions, especially those with high-privilege access (e.g., file system, shell access, database writes).
    2.  **Remediation:** Do not trust server-provided tool code or descriptions. Maintain a hardcoded, client-side registry of approved tools and their functionalities. The server should only be able to request the invocation of a pre-approved tool by name.
    3.  **Hardening:** Implement strict validation on the parameters passed to any tool, ensuring they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious payloads (e.g., path traversal, command injection).
*   **Risk Index:** **95/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Act** (Immediate)
    *   *Decision Rationale:* This is a novel, difficult-to-detect attack vector with extremely high impact on subsequent systems (the tools the LLM can access). The attack is simple to execute for a malicious server. The priority is to `Act`.
*   **Executive Summary:** An attacker can deceive our AI by misrepresenting a malicious tool as a safe one, tricking it into stealing data or executing damaging commands on our infrastructure. We must enforce a strict "trust but verify" model where the AI can only use a pre-approved, vetted set of tools.

---

#### **4. Indirect Prompt Injection via MCP Server**

As analyzed by security researcher Simon Willison, data retrieved from an MCP server can contain hidden instructions that manipulate the LLM's behavior. This can cause the LLM to ignore its original system prompt, leak sensitive data from its context window, or chain attacks by using other tools maliciously.

*   **CVSS Base Score:** **9.7 (Critical)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:L/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N`
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Immediate:** Review and strengthen system prompts to be more robust against injection, including explicit instructions to ignore any user/data-provided commands that contradict its core mission.
    2.  **Remediation:** Implement strong contextual boundaries. When inserting data from an MCP server into the LLM's context, wrap it in structured formats (e.g., XML tags like `<data_from_server>...</data_from_server>`) and instruct the LLM to treat the content within these tags as pure data, not instructions.
    3.  **Hardening:** Scan data retrieved from MCP servers for keywords and patterns indicative of prompt injection attacks (e.g., "ignore previous instructions") before passing it to the LLM.
*   **Risk Index:** **90/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Act** (Immediate)
    *   *Decision Rationale:* Prompt injection is the quintessential LLM vulnerability. Its exploitation via MCP is straightforward and the potential for data exfiltration and integrity loss in subsequent systems is high. The priority is to `Act`.
*   **Executive Summary:** Attackers can embed hidden commands in the data we feed our AI, hijacking its behavior to steal information or perform unauthorized actions. We must implement better separation between instructions and data to ensure our AI remains under our control.
