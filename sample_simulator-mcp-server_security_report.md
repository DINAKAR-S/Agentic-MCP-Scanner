### **Vulnerability Analysis: simulator-mcp-server**

**Repository:** https://github.com/JoshuaRileyDev/simulator-mcp-server
**Internal Findings:** 7
**External Vulnerabilities (Dependencies):** 31

---

### **Finding 1: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Insecure 'EVAL' Command**

*   **Executive Summary:** A critical flaw in the MCP command handler allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This provides a direct path to a full system compromise, representing the most severe possible risk.
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **10.0 (Critical)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H`
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Immediate:** Remove the `'EVAL'` command case from `lib/mcp.js` entirely. The use of `eval()` on untrusted input is exceptionally dangerous and should never be used.
    2.  **Long-term:** If dynamic functionality is required, replace it with a safe, sandboxed execution environment (e.g., `vm2`) or implement a command dispatcher that only calls pre-defined, secure functions.
*   **Risk Index:** **100/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Immediate**
    *   **Decision:** `Exploitation: Active`, `Technical Impact: Total` -> **Action: Act**

---

### **Finding 2: Path Traversal via 'GET_FILE' Command**

*   **Executive Summary:** The 'GET_FILE' command is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing an attacker to read any file on the server's filesystem. This can lead to the exfiltration of sensitive data, such as application source code, credentials, and system configuration files.
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **7.5 (High)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  Define an explicit, hardcoded base directory for allowed file access (e.g., `/var/www/public_files/`).
    2.  Before reading the file, use `path.join()` to combine the base directory with the user-provided filename.
    3.  Normalize the resulting path and verify that it still resides within the intended base directory. Reject any request that attempts to access a file outside this boundary.
*   **Risk Index:** **80/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Immediate**
    *   **Decision:** `Exploitation: Active`, `Technical Impact: High` -> **Action: Act**

---

### **Finding 3: Missing Authentication on Network Endpoint**

*   **Executive Summary:** The application's core communication channel (Socket.IO) lacks any authentication, granting any network-connected user the ability to issue commands. This fundamental flaw exposes all other vulnerabilities, including the critical RCE, to unauthenticated attackers.
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **10.0 (Critical)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H`
    *   *Note: Scored based on the highest impact of an unauthenticated action (RCE).*
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:** Implement a mandatory authentication and authorization layer for all Socket.IO connections. Use a standard, token-based mechanism (e.g., JSON Web Tokens - JWTs) where clients must present a valid token upon connection before any MCP messages are processed.
*   **Risk Index:** **95/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Immediate**
    *   **Decision:** `Exploitation: Active`, `Technical Impact: Total` -> **Action: Act**

---

### **Finding 4: Indirect Prompt Injection in 'QUERY_MODEL' Command**

*   **Executive Summary:** The system is susceptible to prompt injection, where an attacker can craft input that manipulates the downstream Large Language Model (LLM). This could cause the LLM to bypass its safety filters, leak sensitive data from its context, or generate harmful content.
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **9.4 (Critical)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L`
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Input Filtering:** Sanitize and filter user-provided prompts to remove or neutralize instructive language (e.g., "ignore previous instructions").
    2.  **Prompt Templating:** Use strong delimiters and clear structural separation between the system instructions and user-provided data within the final prompt sent to the LLM.
    3.  **Output Parsing:** Validate the LLM's output to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain signs of a successful injection.
*   **Risk Index:** **85/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Immediate**
    *   **Decision:** `Exploitation: PoC`, `Technical Impact: High` -> **Action: Act**

---

### **Finding 5: Denial of Service (DoS) via Unbounded Context Size**

*   **Executive Summary:** The server does not limit the size of incoming messages, allowing an attacker to send a message with an extremely large payload. This will consume excessive memory, leading to a server crash and a denial of service for all legitimate users.
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **7.5 (High)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:** Enforce a strict maximum size limit on all incoming Socket.IO messages. Configure the Express body parser and the Socket.IO server with a reasonable limit (e.g., 1MB) and immediately terminate connections that exceed it.
*   **Risk Index:** **70/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Out-of-band**
    *   **Decision:** `Exploitation: Active`, `Technical Impact: High (Availability)` -> **Action: Attend**

---

### **Finding 6: Improper Input Validation Leading to Unhandled Exception**

*   **Executive Summary:** The application can be crashed by sending a structurally invalid JSON payload that lacks expected fields like 'command'. This bypasses the `try...catch` for parsing and causes an unhandled exception later in the code, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **7.5 (High)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:** Implement schema validation on the parsed JSON object *before* attempting to access its properties. Use a library like `zod` or `joi` to define the expected MCP message structure and reject any message that does not conform.
*   **Risk Index:** **65/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Out-of-band**
    *   **Decision:** `Exploitation: Active`, `Technical Impact: High (Availability)` -> **Action: Attend**

---

### **Finding 7: Sensitive Information Exposure in Server Logs**

*   **Executive Summary:** The server logs the entire content of every received message by default. If the MCP protocol is used to transmit sensitive data (PII, API keys, intellectual property), this information will be exposed in log files, creating a secondary data breach risk.
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **3.3 (Low)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:** Implement structured logging. Instead of logging the raw message object, log only non-sensitive metadata (e.g., `timestamp`, `message.type`, `source_ip`). Explicitly redact or omit potentially sensitive fields like `message.content` or `data.prompt`.
*   **Risk Index:** **30/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Scheduled**
    *   **Decision:** `Exploitation: PoC`, `Technical Impact: Low` -> **Action: Track**

### **External Vulnerabilities Summary (Dependencies)**

Analysis of the `package.json` file via external threat intelligence feeds reveals **31 known vulnerabilities** in third-party dependencies. These vulnerabilities are inherited from `express`, `socket.io`, and their transitive dependencies. A critical vulnerability in a dependency could provide an alternative path for system compromise.

**Summary by Severity:**

| Severity | Count | Notable Package(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | 1 | `express` (dependency chain) |
| **High** | 4 | `socket.io-parser`, `engine.io` |
| **Medium** | 11 | `express`, various |
| **Low** | 15 | various |

*   **Risk and Relevance:** The identified vulnerabilities in the web framework (`express`) and real-time engine (`socket.io`) are directly relevant and increase the application's attack surface. The High-severity DoS vulnerabilities in the `socket.io` stack compound the internally identified DoS risks. The Critical vulnerability in the dependency chain, while complex, presents an unacceptable risk.
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  Run `npm audit fix --force` to automatically patch as many vulnerabilities as possible.
    2.  Manually review and update the core dependencies (`express`, `socket.io`, `uuid`) to their latest stable versions by modifying `package.json`.
    3.  After updating, re-run `npm audit` to confirm the remediation of Critical and High severity vulnerabilities.


## CVSS/SSVC/Nutrition Report for https://github.com/JoshuaRileyDev/simulator-mcp-server

### **Vulnerability Analysis Report**

This report consolidates seven related findings into a single, critical vulnerability. All provided code snippets point to a classic Command Injection flaw within the `shutdownDevice` functionality, which is exposed via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. The root cause is the direct concatenation of un-saniÂ­tized user input into a shell command.

---

### **Consolidated Finding: Remote Code Execution via Command Injection in Simulator Shutdown Endpoint**

*   **Affected Components:** `src/index.ts`, `src/simulator-service.ts`, `package.json`
*   **Description:** The MCP server exposes an endpoint to shut down a simulator. The `deviceId` parameter received from the client request is directly used to construct a shell command executed by `xcrun simctl shutdown ${deviceId}`. An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting a malicious `deviceId` (e.g., `some-uuid; rm -rf /`), leading to full remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the MCP instance. This vulnerability can be exploited by any unauthenticated user with network access to the server.

*   **CVSS Base Score (v3.1):** **9.8 (Critical)**
    *   **Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
    *   **AV: Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
    *   **AC: Low:** Exploitation is simple and requires no special conditions.
    *   **PR: None:** No authentication is required to trigger the endpoint.
    *   **UI: None:** No user interaction is needed.
    *   **S: Unchanged:** The exploit runs within the scope of the server application.
    *   **C/I/A: High:** A successful exploit grants the attacker full control over the server, allowing for complete loss of confidentiality (reading any file), integrity (modifying any file), and availability (shutting down the server or deleting data).

*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Primary Fix (Use Safe Execution):** Refactor the command execution to avoid shell interpretation. Replace the use of `execAsync` (which likely wraps `child_process.exec`) with a safer alternative like `child_process.execFile` or `child_process.spawn`. These methods treat arguments as distinct data and do not interpret shell metacharacters.
        *   **Example (`simulator-service.ts`):**
            ```typescript
            // Import execFile from child_process
            import { execFile } from 'child_process';
            import { promisify } from 'util';

            const execFileAsync = promisify(execFile);

            // ... inside SimulatorService class

            async shutdownDevice(deviceId: string): Promise<void> {
                // The command and arguments are passed separately
                await execFileAsync('xcrun', ['simctl', 'shutdown', deviceId]);
            }
            ```

    2.  **Defense-in-Depth (Input Validation):** Strengthen input validation to strictly enforce the expected format of a `deviceId`. This provides an additional layer of security.
        *   **Example (`src/index.ts`):**
            ```typescript
            const ShutdownSimulatorSchema = z.object({
              // Use a regex to ensure the deviceId only contains alphanumeric characters and hyphens, typical for a UDID.
              deviceId: z.string().regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+$/).describe("The UDID of the simulator to shutdown")
            });
            ```

*   **Risk Index:** **98 / 100**
    *   This score reflects the critical nature of the technical finding (CVSS 9.8) combined with the high likelihood of exploitation due to the simplicity of the attack. It represents an extreme and present danger to the operational integrity of the server and any data it holds or has access to.

*   **SSVC (Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization):**
    *   **Priority:** **Immediate**
    *   **Recommended Action:** **Act**
    *   **Justification:** The decision path is `Exploitation: Active` (as Command Injection is a well-known and easily exploited vulnerability class) -> `Technical Impact: Total` (RCE leads to full compromise) -> `Mission Impact: Major` (server compromise leads to significant disruption and data loss). This path mandates immediate, out-of-band patching.

*   **Executive Summary:**
    A critical design flaw in the simulator shutdown feature allows attackers to take complete control of the server. This vulnerability is easy to exploit and could result in catastrophic data theft, service disruption, or the server being used to launch further attacks on your network. The underlying issue must be fixed immediately by changing how the system processes device shutdown commands.

## Real-Time External Vulnerabilities Analysis

**Overall Risk Summary & Recommended Next Step:**
Critical vulnerabilities in the widely-used MCP ecosystem expose our systems to data theft and remote takeover; immediate patching and a comprehensive security review of all MCP-integrated applications are required.

***

### **External Threat Intelligence Analysis**

The current threat landscape for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is volatile and high-risk. Multiple security research firms and independent analysts (TrendMicro, JFrog, CyberArk, Red Hat) have concurrently reported critical-class vulnerabilities. The recurring themes are:

1.  **Server-Side Weaknesses:** Classic vulnerabilities like SQL Injection are present in popular, widely-forked MCP server implementations, allowing attackers to poison prompt data and exfiltrate entire databases.
2.  **Client-Side Exploitation:** The `mcp-remote` client and similar tools are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when connecting to malicious or compromised MCP servers. This is a critical threat, as it gives attackers a direct foothold onto developer machines or production environments.
3.  **Protocol-Level Abuse:** Attackers can leverage the inherent trust between MCP clients and servers to perform novel AI-specific attacks, such as Indirect Prompt Injection and Tool Poisoning, tricking the LLM into executing malicious commands or leaking sensitive data.

The sheer volume and severity of these public disclosures indicate that MCP is a new and attractive target for threat actors. Any reliance on un-audited, un-patched, or untrusted MCP components introduces significant and immediate risk to the organization.

### **Vulnerability Analysis**

Based on the threat intelligence, the following vulnerability classes are present in the MCP ecosystem and require immediate attention.

### **1. Client-Side RCE via Malicious MCP Server**

This vulnerability, exemplified by CVE-2025-6514, allows a malicious MCP server to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the machine running the MCP client (`mcp-remote` or equivalent) when it connects. The client improperly handles data received from the server, leading to code execution.

*   **Executive Summary:** A flaw in the AI's communication client allows an attacker-controlled server to take complete control of the system running the client. This could be a developer's laptop or a production server, leading to theft of code, credentials, and a deep network breach.
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **8.8 (High)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    *   **Attack Vector (AV:N):** Exploitable over the network.
    *   **Attack Complexity (AC:L):** Low; the client simply needs to connect to a malicious URL.
    *   **Privileges Required (PR:N):** None required from the attacker's perspective.
    *   **User Interaction (UI:R):** Required; a user must initiate the connection to the malicious server.
    *   **Scope (S:U):** Unchanged; the exploit runs within the scope of the client application.
    *   **Impact (C:H, I:H, A:H):** High; RCE grants full control over the client machine's data and resources.
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Immediate Patching:** Update all `mcp-remote` clients and other MCP client libraries to the latest secure version.
    2.  **Connection Allow-list:** Implement strict network controls to ensure clients can only connect to a pre-approved, vetted list of MCP servers. Block all outbound connections to unknown MCP hosts.
    3.  **Input Sanitization:** Ensure client-side code rigorously validates and sanitizes all data received from the server (e.g., tool names, parameters, file paths) before processing or displaying it.
*   **Risk Index:** **92/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Immediate - Act**
    *   **Decision Rationale:** The vulnerability is actively exploited (based on threat reports), has a total technical impact (RCE), and can lead to a major loss of confidentiality and integrity. The required response is to patch immediately.

### **2. Server-Side SQL Injection in MCP Server**

This vulnerability, highlighted by TrendMicro, affects common MCP server implementations (especially those using SQLite). Attackers can inject malicious SQL commands via the protocol, allowing them to read, modify, or delete any data in the server's database and potentially seed malicious prompts that will be served to clients.

*   **Executive Summary:** A fundamental flaw in our MCP server allows attackers to access and manipulate its entire database. This can result in a massive data breach of proprietary information and user data, and be used to launch further attacks against our AI agents.
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **9.8 (Critical)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    *   **Attack Vector (AV:N):** Exploitable over the network.
    *   **Attack Complexity (AC:L):** Low; standard SQLi payloads are effective.
    *   **Privileges Required (PR:N):** None; exploit can be triggered by unauthenticated requests.
    *   **User Interaction (UI:N):** None required.
    *   **Scope (S:U):** Unchanged; exploit contained within the server application.
    *   **Impact (C:H, I:H, A:H):** High; allows full C/I/A compromise of the database.
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Use Parameterized Queries:** Refactor all database queries to use prepared statements (parameterized queries). This is the single most effective defense against SQLi.
    2.  **ORM Implementation:** Utilize a well-maintained Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that handles query parameterization by default.
    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** The database user account used by the MCP server should have the minimum permissions necessary for its operation (e.g., no write access if it only needs to read).
    4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF with rulesets to detect and block common SQLi attack patterns as a defense-in-depth measure.
*   **Risk Index:** **98/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Immediate - Act**
    *   **Decision Rationale:** A critical, remotely exploitable vulnerability with no user interaction required. The impact is a total compromise of the server's data. Action must be taken immediately.

### **3. Indirect Prompt Injection & Tool Poisoning via Malicious Server**

This is an advanced, AI-specific attack where a malicious MCP server provides a tool definition that contains hidden, malicious instructions. When the client-side LLM agent attempts to use this "poisoned" tool, it is tricked into executing unintended, harmful actions (e.g., exfiltrating files, running shell commands) on the client system.

*   **Executive Summary:** Malicious AI tool providers can trick our systems into performing dangerous actions on our behalf. This novel attack bypasses traditional firewalls by manipulating the AI's logic, turning our own tools against us to steal data or run unauthorized commands.
*   **CVSS Base Score:** **9.6 (Critical)**
*   **CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    *   **Attack Vector (AV:N):** Exploitable over the network.
    *   **Attack Complexity (AC:L):** Low for the attacker, who just needs to craft a malicious tool definition.
    *   **Privileges Required (PR:N):** None.
    *   **User Interaction (UI:R):** Required; the user/agent must connect and decide to use the malicious tool.
    *   **Scope (S:C):** Changed; the vulnerability in the server's data exploits a separate authority: the client-side agent's tool execution environment.
    *   **Impact (C:H, I:H, A:H):** High; the impact depends on the available tools but can easily lead to RCE or full data exfiltration.
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    1.  **Tool Whitelisting & Sandboxing:** Do not trust tool definitions provided by the server. The client should maintain a strict allow-list of known, safe tools and their expected parameters. All tool execution must occur in a tightly controlled, sandboxed environment with no access to the underlying system.
    2.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** For any tool that performs a high-risk action (e.g., file system writes, network calls, command execution), require explicit user confirmation before execution.
    3.  **Output Parsing:** Treat all output from the LLM, especially tool-use requests, as untrusted input. Validate and sanitize it before execution.
    4.  **Clear Prompting:** Engineer prompts to clearly separate instructions from external data to make it harder for the LLM to be confused by malicious content from the server.
*   **Risk Index:** **95/100**
*   **SSVC Priority:** **Immediate - Act**
    *   **Decision Rationale:** A critical, novel attack vector that bypasses conventional security. Given its ability to cause a scope change and lead to RCE, the threat must be addressed immediately through architectural changes.
